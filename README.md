# (Factors affecting Borrower APR)
## by (Kosiso Aniebue)


## Dataset

> The dataset consisted of borrower APRs and attributes of 113,937 loans. The attributes included original loan amount, borrower's Prosper rating, loan term, borrower's stated monthly income, as well as many other features such as borrower's employment status, debt to income ratio, current loan status etc.


## Summary of Findings

> According to the data, the borrower APR is negatively correlated with original loan amount. 
At different sizes of the loan amount, the APR has a large range, but the range of APR generally decrease with the increase in loan amount

> The borrower APR also decreases with increasingly better rating. Borrowers with the best Prosper ratings have the lowest APR. This shows that the Prosper rating has a very strong effect on borrower APR. Interestingly, the relationship between borrower APR and loan amount turns from negative to slightly positive when the Prosper ratings increases from HR to A or better. This is may because people with A or AA ratings tend to borrow more money, increasting the APR could prevent them from borrowing even more and maximize the profit. But people with lower ratings tend to borrow less money, by decreasing APR one could encourage them to borrow more. 

>The data also showed that the borrower APR decrease with the increase of borrow term for people with HR-C raings. But for people with B-AA ratings, the APR increase with the increase of borrow term.

>  The exploration revealed that the loan amount is positively correlated with the stated monthly income, which makes sense since borrowers with more monthly income could access more loans. The loan amount is also increased with the increase of loan term. It also showed that borrowers with larger monthly income and loan amount have better ratings. 

> Employed, self-employed and full time borrowers have more monthly income and loan amount than part-time, retired and not employed borrowers. Proportionally, there are more 60-month loans on B and C ratings. There is only 36 months loans for HR rating borrowers. For loan amount, there is a interaction between term and rating. With better Prosper rating, the loan amount of all three terms increases, the increase in amplitude of loan amount between terms also becomes larger.



## Key Insights for Presentation

> Focus is on Borrower APR and features that influenced it like original loan amount, etc. 
> I started by showing the distribution of borrower APR and loan amount variable. Then, I showed the relationship between APR vs. loan amount, as well as APR vs. Employment Status. I also investigated the effect of rating on  APR and loan amount, as well as the effect of rating on relationship between borrower APR and term.
